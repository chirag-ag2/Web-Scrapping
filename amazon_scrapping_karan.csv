23,Karthik,2020-06-17,Fire TV Stick,True,1.0,Useless,"Update: as soon as I gave a 1 star rating Amazon support contacted me(within few hours). They seem determined to address any issues I have and convince me to fix my rating so I appreciate their customer care but I sort of see how this product listing has so many good reviews despite its flaws. Mr.Bezos is not kidding around ppl.
----------------------------------------------------------
Pathetic device. Everything is slow and the interface is not very friendly to use. Even Amazon apps take around 25 secs to get to the profile selection screen! All apps r noticeably slower compared to Google chromecast.
Search is especially worst. Getting Alexa to understand Indian accent is a cruel punishment. I had hoped this would help my old mother to easily look for things to watch but she has given up on it. The fire tv interface has crashed multiple times when u r watching something and decide to pause it and later want to resume it. I had to turn it off and on to make it work. Prime video deserves its own 1 star rating as it is a piece of crap compared to Netflix. Don't go for this device and save ur money."

150,Amazon Customer,2020-06-12,Fire TV Stick,True,1.0,Don't buy this.,"Never had as many issues with any device as this one.
Bought in February 2020. Once a month, it would freeze and needed a factory reset, a tedious process given that you need to pair the remote again. Faster two resets in March and April, it refused to pair the remote altogether, rendering the device useless. Thanks to the pandemic, Amazon was unable to replace the remote and the device was completely useless during two months of lockdown, a time when it should have been in use the maximum.
After the remote was replaced, plugged in the device for the first time to the TV, it showed the Amazon logo twice and then completely went off, just a big black blank screen.
Contacting support is a painful process, with options unavailable from the order page.
You're better off buying a chromecast or an Android TV, or even a simple HDMI cable that hooks your computer to the TV. At least it works, and is reliable."

One major negative though is the battery life of remote. It is unbelievably bad. The battery does not last more than 3 weeks. So to reduce that expense, I bought a battery charger and bought chargeable batteries. Those dont work.
I would have thought that remote's battery problems were history. I guess in case of amazon, they are not.
Hope they fix it quick."

257,Amazon Customer,2020-06-08,Fire TV Stick,True,1.0,Poor product and customer support experience,"The FireTV stick stopped connecting to network within 2 days of setup. Along with the no network message, the remote also stopped working, so absolutely helpless situation. Tried all troubleshooting techniques mentioned on various firetv forums to connect the remote, without being able to get to resolution. Tried the Return/ replace option and had to suffer 15 minutes of useless questions after which the agent wanted to put me on hold to ask someone if he could replace both the device and the remote. Apparently they can do one or the other on a brand new device that is defective. After a thoroughly frustrating conversation, decided to cancel the order and just get a refund. Not planning to get a new one!"

279,Jay Ruparelia,2020-06-07,Fire TV Stick,True,4.0,Superb product!,"Using this (non 4k version) for 6+ months now.
Giving 1less star for its delay in loading time. ( It is delaying in loading only when you first start in a day)
It will truly turn your simple led/lcd tv in to latest Android smartTV.
Some Good :
You get some 5+gb free space to install apps from its own app store + other websites & app store or from your mobile.
(==> Plz check many videos on YouTube to learn how to download & install apps from other websites & app stores & from your mobile)
It's wifi detection & connection is smooth so far.
Remote works just superb. It actually uses bluetooth for working rather than infrared.
You can pair your TV's on-off & volume function with fireTv's remote once & then your life will be easier.
Alexa's voice recognition it decent. Wait, at this price range- its awesome!!
Screen mirroring from your mobile devices is just fine. It will always lag for 0.5 to 1 second, however.
I didn't tried, but you can connect other usb storage device to it with some extra accessories available on Amazon. Need to buy them separately.
Mobile app for remote is quite a handy & smooth app. Must download it & use it.
Some Bad:
Loading time is jsut enjoying.
Earlier it used to took 20-30 sec to load when you first time power it ON in a day, but from last 2months its taking longer - sometime up to 1 min.
( Sometimes, some particular app is also taking 40-50sec to laod - this may be fireTv or that app's server issue)
You may run out of space for apps as 5+gb is not that good number. Right!
No option to turn off any particular app. ( Though some app have function that if you click back button twice, it will exit that app)
No option to turn off FireTv itself. Yes, that ture, if you are watching videos & you just turn off Tv, then firetv will keep running videos and consume yout internet & electricity.
( You will have to remember to stop video, come out of that app & then turn off tv) ( or simply unplug electricity supply of Firetv)"

Incase they have problems under warranty they will keep you waiting indefinitely before replacing it with a new one. Its been 5 days and they havent even shipped me a new one in the name of pandemic. However i bought other items during peak lockdown period and still i got delivery in 4-5 days. But they are failing to ship the replacement despite the lockdown being lifted.
When it comes to replacing an expensive fire stick they are giving vague excuses. I have called 10 times in 5 days and i have got 10 different answers but none correct. When i demand to speak to a senior exexutive, the call never transfers and automatically disconnects after 10 mins of holding and waiting.
Fire stick 4k has many issues. Please google its defects before buying. When watching a show or movie it keeps exiting to main menu or to a blank screen every 2 mins. Google for this problem. Many across the world seem to have suffered from same problem.
The Fires stick has access to some great shows and movies on different channels but unfortunately pathetic after sales services should be considered before buying it from Amazon."

Pros:
1) It gets the job done and is relatively faster.
2) The Alexa integration is awesome as it recommends the apps based on the content you asked to search. So, it provides an across the app search which you don't have to do manually.
3) Other things are basic smart TV stuff which it gets right. There is an app store which help you get through with your content consumption. The apps are plenty so no issues with them.
Cons:
1) On startup, it takes a bit of time to initialize but after that it works fine.
2) Amazon sent a 1 year old piece which had one of the batteries busted. I had to put a new battery on this.
3) I had restart issues while connecting to Mobile through screen mirroring but it connected fine with a new phone so I attributed that to my old phone."

533,Koushik dey,2020-05-26,Fire TV Stick,True,5.0,Firestick,"Works great as replacement for cable as long as you have someone with cable's log in or can send them the code on your tv to log in for you using their cell phone or desktop browser for the local cable channel apps and any premium apps they are subscribed to. Cable log in apps for premium channels are HBO Go, NOT HBO Now (monthly subscription, not provider log in) and Showtime Anytime, not Showtime (another subscription, not log in service). Make sure to ONLY click on apps that say LOG IN, not FREE TRIAL. If click FREE TRIAL, then your card on file for Amazon WILL BE CHARGED with NO ""Are you Sure"" or other confirmation link after accidentally clicking start free trial, when u wanted to actually log in with cable provider. I just feel like Amazon tricks customers into making accidental purchases by having multiple apps for the same premium channels as named above, and has NO PROTECTION to prevent you or someone else from accidentally charging YOUR card because they clicked a Free Trial app. You CANNOT turn off purchases or setup dual authentication for purchases for the firestick, and even when tech support walks you through turning off purchases on the firestick through the website, it does NOT turn off purchases on the firesticks. Setting parental controls denies you access to the apps, so if set the controls and add a pin, once pin is used to access EVERY app except G rated apps, someone can STILL click Free Trial accidentally. That's my only issue but it's with Amazon, not the firestick because Amazon is the one not making provisions to prevent accidental charges and they force you to sign into an Amazon account with payment card attached in order to even access firestick content. Since Prime is charged automatically every month, if you add a default prepaid card with $1 on it, so accidental charges fail, your Prime can't be charged until you switch default cards, but you can't make a one time payment and have to leave the card as default until Amazon decides to charge it for Prime... giving someone a window of opportunity to accidentally charge your card."

Also known as ultra High Definition or HDR, 4k streaming devices are the best in class.
My Fire Stick  is capable of streaming both SD (Standard Definition) and HD (High Definition) picture qualities, but not capable of HDR quality. I come to learn that my LG TV is not enabled for ultra HD streaming.
Being used to watching SD quality TV shows regularly, streaming HD quality contents with Fire Stick feels such a huge improvement in terms of picture clarity. No doubt it consumes lots of Wifi data on my phone SIM cards. Until I have a reliable broadband, I shall be content with this Fire Stick to stream news and movie contents (eg.

581,Neville,2020-05-24,Fire TV Stick,True,5.0,Awesome Product - Must of all (See review),"I have Been off Cable tv and set top box combo for almost a year now ..
Thanks to this tiny device which turns your device from a boring TV to a super smart TV.
Pros**
-Integrates with any modern tv big or small just needs a HDMI port,
-Basic Installation .. does not need any expertise of any kind to set this up
-Can be directly linked with your amazon account to directly login and use . or a login page will help you with that
-Wide array of apps and support for the device ..
-Supports major formats and works with Wireless N Dualband routers aswell
- Alexa support and voice command is a great addition
- After getting some apps you can continue to enjoy your normal TV programme routine .
- Works on FireOs which is mostly Android .. so you can install your android apps on this aswell
- It Integrated with my Samsung TV (non Smart) so i don't need the Tv remote to switch on or change volume aswell
Now for the Cons **
-Has very Limited Storage Space (8gb) and Ram (1gb) combined with a Mali45o processor @1.3Ghz
-Expensive Spares Such as cost of extra remote alone is Rs-1999
-Due to limited hardware power .. if you happen to install wide array of Apps / Games etc then the firestick Tends to get  a bit slow
-Alexa voice search is limited . As it will work well with Prime video & Youtube  however it doe not extend the search to the Content within other apps Like Hotstar Or  Netflix
-No Expandable storage(Mem card etc). So cant download much content to device(see Con #1)
Even with all this ...I am extremely Happy and pleased with the Amamzon Firestick .. and would buy it again if needed without any hesitation .
Advice to to other is If you have a tv which has 4k .. or if you are planning to buy/upgrade to a 4k Tv in the near future then Please Go for the Firestick 4K version .. as it is much better than this regular one .. i.e Higher Speed , More RAM, Newer OS and 4k support
Hope you liked this sincere review of mine. cheers"

585,Murthy,2020-05-24,Fire TV Stick,True,3.0,Very slow to start,"The product is very slow to start, as slow as Tata Sky setup box. It‚Äôs just frustrating if you are trying to show something to someone, just waiting for it to start. Once it start it‚Äôs lot better, handily seen any hanging/freezing. I have ACT with 80MBps and the router is 15feet away and I can see the stick, if I stand next to my router. My smart TV has Prime, Netflix and other apps, it‚Äôs way faster to load those apps, but this stick takes a awe full lot of time.
+++Update+++
Post this review I promptly got a call from Amazon and they offered to replace the device within warranty though it went outside warranty. Based on my previous experience with other company, the replacement device does not necessarily mean it will be better, thus refused the replacement.
Meanwhile I updated the device and timed the loading time with ACT (100mbps) with Jio (100mbps), ACT was faster by 2 seconds, in that instance.
There is no doubt that the clarity is very good in this firestick when compared to Jio Setup box, there is no comparison at this point (30 May 2020), while Jio still working on the clarity and number of channel (what I understand from the rep. from Jio).
Thus moved from 2 star to 3 star for this product. Why not 4 star? That is because it not only takes little more than a min to load the firestick, but takes almost another minute to load the app, for example youtube app. Overall takes around 2 min to run an app on this. Again once its loaded, its awesome."

638,Abhishek,2020-05-21,Fire TV Stick,True,1.0,Worst Service,"I would like to share some pros and cons of the product
Pros: Never got to see the performance from the day I purchased the product
Cons:
1. I purchased from a well know showroom from a nearby location, struggled to connect as it was unable to pull signals from the JIOFI dongle (may be the faulty network)
2. Amazon Batteries provided with the stick were dead, Remote seems to be battery hungry as new batteries were not working too (remote faulty or battery faulty)
3. Setting were almost complete, firestick device asking to press home button to start but remote does not work.
Tried with another new pair of batteries and suddenly home button works fine
4. searching for Wifi and suddenly device asks to press play/pause button and again the remote does not work
5. Called the showroom guy asking for help. Guy at the showroom asks to bring the device and will check
6. showroom guy takes the device with remote and charger goes in somewhere within 5 mins tells ""sir remote not working you have to get replaced from amazon itself. I instructed him to press home button for 10 secs and light blinks fine in remote
7. Called amazon troubleshooting unsuccessful and replacement placed by customer care representative and not sure when the product can be shipped due to lockdown situation
8. Called back the customer care next day to check if the replacement was dispatched as it was not showing in the app. representative told he is raising  a replacement and soon i will receive a message (No Msg Recd)
9. Called one more time to customer care in the afternoon to check why the msg not received rep told replacement not raised yet and its under follow up. He too was unable to raise a replacement
10. Evening call with customer care representative and told raised replacement which finally shows in app yet to dispatch till today 21st May (purchase date 16th May, Complaint raised 17th May, replacement raised 18th May)
11. Checked what if we buy a new product shows as 1 day delivery but replacement product yet to dispatch even after 5 days
Overall experience - Only new customer is priority no matter its a prime or non prime, replacement may take weeks but buying new product does not even take 2 days for getting delivered"

645,harmeet singh,2020-05-21,Fire TV Stick,True,1.0,Amazon *Fake* stick,"**FAKE PRODUCT **
I would first clear that you see 2 remotes here. The glossy one already belongs to me, the matte one i got when i reordered Amazon fire stick.
The quality of the plastic of the matte one is so downgraded that it actually felt that its fake.  It was way lighter that the glossy one does not gives confidence that it will last longer.
Secondly the issue with the product I received that it never connected. Yes this product is defective and is not working at all.
As soon as you plug in fire stick in your TV to set up, the remote is not responding.
Since I already have at my home so I knew how to set up this device but the one I ordered recently is not connecting.
This leaves a huge doubt in my mind that this product could be fake. And even it is genuine and authentic, the picture uploaded of two remotes says the story.
I highly recommend not to buy this from this seller."

No more going through a frustrating experience of connecting a laptop to the TV via a HDMI cable or having to download a host of applications. One remote does it all while the Fire stick itself sits silently behind the TV.
Be it switching on the TV, viewing a host of streaming media and thousands of shows, controlling volume or even integrating seamlessly with an Echo device using Alexa's capabilities. We are simply mesmerised with its features, ease of set-up and simplicity (image of the remote proves the point) No wonder I said, it's ""Beyond just Words"" Highly recommended..."

716,Raghavaram,2020-05-14,Fire TV Stick,True,2.0,Firestick corrupted my TV's audio driver costing me the whole motherboard,"I purchased the fire stick on 15th October I was using it on my Sony Bravia WB 900 television with out any issues till last month. But on a particular day I had observed that the video was getting frozen causing lip sink and then I assumed it to be some network issue. It continued the same way for the next day and all of a sudden there was no image  and the television was getting turned off into safe mode. Authorised service person had take a look at my television and said that the mother board might have been corrupted due to audio driver issue. Due to lock down I couldn't get that repaired and brought a spare sony TV from my friend's house. To my surprise the moment I connected the firestick which ran well for 3-4 hours, the same problem seems to be repeating. Suspecting it could damage the TV again, I disconnected my firestick and given it back to my friend. My friend also has firestick and he was not facing the issue. Then I suspicious that the firestick that I was using could have corrupted my TV. To confirm the same I connected to another model TV (panasonic) in my neighborhood and after running it for 4-5 hrs I could see the same problem of video getting stuck. Sorry for long feedback but I felt this make others for being more cautious. Please let me know if anyone have faced such issues using firestick.
Now I have to incur a cost of about 15k to replace my TV's motherboard and I would be glad if Amazon could atleast replace my firestick for free of cost."

732,Punyaslok Dash,2020-05-13,Fire TV Stick,False,5.0,Personal review After 2 years use,"I had 2nd Generation FireTV Stick for 2 years and recently remote stopped working. I sold it in OLX for 800 without remote. Overall I am satisfied but disappointed as well that it stopped working just in 2 years. There are no service center or aftermarket parts I can buy easily. Only option to buy a new one so this time I switched to MI TV 4k just lunched in Flipkart for 3500. The points I don't like in FireTV as below:
1. Outdated Hardware with overloading OS. 1GB RAM, 1.2 Quadcore unspecified CPU, 8GB ROM. But I like its OS, very smooth and well integrated with Applications.
2. Very much Overpriced, its like I paid for Amazon logo not for the device. Just like old days people paid for BlackBerry phone.
3. No practical service center or support in India. You are lucky if your device still functions. Congratulations!!
4. No aftermarket cheap parts available or supported by the device. Example like Remote, Charger, LAN cable etc. Original parts will cost 50 to 80% of the actual device cost. You can buy a small TV in that price.
The fact is only buy if you are a diehard fan of Amazon FireTV. Else there is no sense to buy this in this price point at 2020 except its available 80% discounted price. Waiting for Amazon to introduce the newest version soon. I cant deny this fact that when FireTV lunched it was ahead of its time but now unfortunately its outdated. Its upto your decision now. I just reviewed my very personal opinion about the device."

Being a Prime member with unlimited access to Prime Videos/Music (which I hardly access due to my Netflix), I decided to buy Fire Stick for our old non-smart-tv in our daughter's room (Part of a little gift for our little one who just turned 9 this Feb 2020). Bought it on Dec 2019, also cancelled my Netflix subscription. But today, 14th March 2020, Amazon decided to cancel my prime membership by dropping a beautiful text saying, 'Your Prime membership has been deactivated.' My little Angel couldn't get access to her movies anymore. Thank you Amazon!
If I have known this is how its going to turn out, I would have bought Apple TV (easy access to her iMac), or Airtel Xstream Box (being a Gold member with Airtel). Dearly regretted my decision now.
So, let me go back to Netflix (I would rather pay for Netflix than Prime - 'not even comparable' )."

Just after 4 months with a minimal uses the device got damaged. I informed the issue to Amazon and got a refurbished FireTV Stick as a replacement but the new stick was not paired up with the FireTV Remote. I talked with Amazon Service Agent but could not help me out and told me that they will replace the remote again. After few days I got a new Remote again its not paired up with the stick.
I was told that the issue was escalated to the technical team and would be contacted within 24 Hrs. But till today I am not contacted by any of their technical member.
Now I am asked by one Amazon Service Agent to buy a new FireTV stick and I will be refunded for the purchase.
Now the question is why I need to buy again.. and why Amazon don't send me a fresh device and sending me every time a refurbished faulty thing. Since I did not buy a refurbished product, I deserve to get fresh thing.
So I request pls don't go for this particular device. Personally I am using Amazon Kindle, Alexa but didn't have any issue like this. Just ignore this device. I had a very bad experience with this since January, 2020. Now 3 months is over but my issue is not resolved yet."

Also there is a design flaw with the remote power on/off system. When i put my Firestick in sleep mode, switching the TV off with the power button located in the Firestick remote will turn on the Firestick. This is a design flaw which needs to be addressed."

I have purchased this in May 2019.
I have been facing different types of issue since a last 2 months.
1. Netflix is getting stucked.
2. Remote is not working.
3. With Netflix blacks screen suddenly come up
4. Audio is not coming up
Customer care keeps giving initial fix like:
1. Reset account
2. Factory reset
3. Hold remote's home button
At the ends, they have committed to replace stick only. Now, it there is any issue with remote then they will replace remote if still it's under warranty duration. Otherwise visit service center and spoil your money. Why don't they replace the whole device, although is under warranty and having this much issues.
The product does not even long last a year!!!
Better to buy, DTH connection with WiFi services."

Infact I have learnt it a hard way that never buy an expensive thing from amazon. Amazon simply dust off its hands when a problem arises during a big purchase. Once you have a problem with the product you will keep hanging between amazon their so called reseller (this is the guy who actually sells the product with 100% backing of amazon) and the brand. All 3 will kep kicking you like a football without any resolution.

1632,Amazon Customer,2020-03-02,Fire TV Stick,True,3.0,NOT elderly  friendly,"I bought it so that my mom can catch up with her missed soap opera episodes. It is unnecessarily hard to navigate through apps.  There is no way to pin TV shows on home screen so that it can be easily accessed. You have to go through various sections and menus to find specific shows. You can't set favorites or playlists of shows you like. Home screen is prime video. You need to download apps like zee5, voot, sony LIV to watch their content. It is my theory that these apps are purposefully made hard to navigate so that senior citizen population sticks to paying for DTH.  Alexa voice search is terrible. Can't recognize single non English word. And voice search will work with Prime Video only. You can not use alexa for voice search in  other apps. Zee5 app crashed multiple times in a span of few hours while navigating through it. P.S. My Fire TV Stick was running on latest software version. Comes with media tek processor. Something like Snapdragon 835/845 would have been awesome."

1748,Siddhesh More,2020-02-28,Fire TV Stick,True,4.0,Great product but here are some suggestions,"PROS:
1. I love the FireTV interface.
2. Streaming quality and the Dolby sound really brings out the best from your TV.
3. There are a ton of apps and features, so you're never out of content.
4. Alexa sometimes
5. Value for money
CONS:
1. Alexa: yeah, voice recognition is very ordinary and there are a lot of misunderstandings. For example, If I want to watch ""Lore on Amazon video"". Even after saying the above words, Alexa just mishears the word lore as lower, ignores everything else I said and lowers the volume.
2. Alexa shows results only from Amazon services, Netflix and Hotstar. I wish Alexa could search into other apps too like JioCinema and return those results. So at the end of the day, you still have to open every other app and search what you want.
3. Alexa should really support a command like ""type"". I should be able to tell Alexa what to type in a text box instead of struggling with an on-screen keyboard.
Now you must be wondering, why 4 stars ? Because there is no better competitor to this product anyway. Mi TV box is expensive and I've heard a lot many complains about its laggy nature and the lack of prime content support."

Streaming quality is good, and if you dont set data management then it will stream in 1080p easily.

At 1.5 yrs old, my firestick hangs on a regular basis, requiring a removal from the port, or power restart. The batteries last between 2-3 weeks. Since I do not have cable, the expense makes sense to an extent. Asking the customer care of the expected life span of this product did not get me an answer till now.

2212,Sir Shop-a-Lot,2020-01-27,Fire TV Stick,True,5.0,Another one of life-changing and unique Amazon products. Definitively a Must Have!,"Discount:
Bought it for a discount at 3199INR. It's available on this price at almost all the amazon sales, so better to google upcoming sales and then purchase.
Uses:
I use it for internet surfing, video streaming, music, games, screen-mirroring (from phone, tablet, PC), and live TV (through JioTV). No point in paying for Tata Sky and the likes since you can install JioTV and enjoy live television for free.
Additional features:
i) Remote:
Premium build, ergonomic design, and flawless voice recognition. All of the buttons are well spaced and tactile to press. The voice search works most of the time, but manual typing requires selecting letters one by one from  the on-screen keyboard using remote keys, so that becomes a hassle sometimes. The remote has buttons for skipping forward and backward in the video, so navigating becomes really easy.
ii) Bluetooth Connectivity:
There's also the option to pair the Firestick with bluetooth supporting devices such as mouse, keyboard, earphones, etc. Typing with a keyboard is a lot easier than using the on-screen keyboard, and there's an app called 'Mouse Toggle' which enables a mouse pointer which can be controlled by a bluetooth mouse for easier surfing in some apps. Bluetooth earphones work perfectly too, with no loss in quality.
iii) Internet surfing
It has an inbuilt browser. There is also a way to install FireFox browser in it as well. Coupled with a keyboard and a mouse, accessing internet becomes as easy as it is on PC.
iv) Universal search for all the streaming apps
Just press the voice search button, say the name of the movie or series, and it will search through all of your apps to find where it's hosted. Really convenient to have everything in one place.
v) Other awesome features
There's a button for quickly changing audio and subtitle language on the remote itself.
Whatever you play gets resumed from where you've left it.
Recently played videos are shown at the home-screen.
Automatically connects to the saved networks.
Privacy friendly, with options to opt-out of user experience programme.
Many more little conveniences, making streaming a pleasurable experience.
Only suggestion I'd make is that they should make their UI more cleaner, especially at the pause screen of the videos.
Final words:
So far, it has been a complete positive experience. I've bought two of them and replaced my Tata Sky subsciptions. If you have a decent internet connection with unlimited bandwidth, then FireStick is for you."

2239,Minouti Kharbade,2020-01-26,Fire TV Stick,True,2.0,Substandard products without proper quality checks,"The device is not good.....it frequently reboots Nd restarts itself . Even after spending more than 30 mins on call with customer care the only option is to get a replacement device. For me even the replacement device had the same issues and had to raise another replacement request. One device is understandable but if multiple products are facing the same issue, it is reasonable to doubt the quality of the product itself.
It is not worth the time, effort, money and weekends that you spend wasting with the device. I think amazon is giving substandard products across here, and I would not recommend it to anyone."

2248,Rahul Saklani,2020-01-26,Fire TV Stick,True,3.0,Not for the advance person.. Nothing Free with this stick,"I bought the stick few days ago and I am disappoint with  the product still I gave it 3 star as it could be a interested product  for new users or non technical person.
Nothing is free with this stick you have to purchase all separate subscription for all available option. I already have Amazon prime subscription and Zee 5 also so these two are useful for me rest all are garbage. Prime has mostly English content so it‚Äôs also waste for hindi use.
There should be plug and play but you required a separate power adapter although I am using LED‚Äôs USB port for the same. Home screen is so much confusing that you even don‚Äôt know from which app you are viewing ur contents and this get worst when you play something from the app for which u don‚Äôt subscribed.
Even you can‚Äôt control the quality of a running video even in amazon prime. APK file can‚Äôt be download even Chrome can‚Äôt be install. Very limited app in store
Over all a cheap IP tv box can do all these thing in a low cost even u could do much more like Live tv also available in tv box . Many advance product are available for it replacement"

2393,Akhil Kumar,2020-01-22,Fire TV Stick,True,3.0,Innovation is done on pretty laggy hardware,"Pros:
1. Amazing services like Prime, Netflix, Hotstar comes in pretty small package.
2. New updates are coming every time.
3. The Screen Mirroring option is there. Its a bit laggy but still better than any other Android or Smart TV setup.
Cons:
1. The Hardware Stick has pretty slow processor and takes ages to boot sometimes and navigate between the apps.
2. The Streaming Stick has slow Wifi reception. My router is not even 2 meters away  however I've seen the stick giving up on 100 mbps connection.
This was observed several times.
The hardware is not capable enough to provide seamless streaming yet an OK product from Amazon"
2394,Local Customer 19009122,2020-01-22,Fire TV Stick,True,1.0,FireTv issues post a year,"The device works only for a year. Post that it keeps giving issues, constantly crashes, resetting till you get tired and switch it off. Have reported this issue multipe times, but the customer service team say they are bound by their process to honor replacement requests only up to 1 year, even if they do understand that the device is not working properly. They can't explain the limited 1 year warranty.
Customer service is only offering to reach out to service center, who will charge a fee, plus the time taken, and I am not sure  about guarantees for the paid repair as it will be a third party.
The extended warranty which exists as per the customer service cannot be found on the Amazon website.
Earlier I had raised an issue of remote batteries draining too fast spending on Duracell batteries every 2 weeks - that's a substantial cost for a years usage The battery problem still remains. I am sad about how Customer service team is handling these issues relating to FireTv, not meeting my expectations, and Amazon's reputation of being a professional company is at stake."

However gave me shock as the remote was not working initially - the supplied AAA batteries were dead!
Was worried about the length of USB cable as mostly they are too short. This one was perfect for me. I guess it is around 4 to 5 ft in length.
Voice recognition without training is quite impressive. Being compatible with my Samsung TV for volume and power on/off is a plus. I can get rid of one remote now :-)
Only one minor niggle - would have appreciated a USB Port for connecting Pen Drive etc. To watch offline media."
2443,Ravi chaurasia,2020-01-19,Fire TV Stick,True,5.0,The Amazon Fire TV Stick is one of the least expensive streamers you can buy.,"I got my 55"" flat screen TV just before the ""smart TVs"" with wi-fi access to download streaming apps came out. However, I've been fine for the past 10 years getting the basic streaming apps such as Netflix and YouTube via my Bluray player. When Disney + came out... I was stuck because that Bluray player does not have the ability to download any new streaming apps. There are many solutions for this issue and I just elected to go with the Amazon Fire TV Stick because it is relatively inexpensive when on sale... and I just plug it into a spare HDMI jack. Now I can get the Disney + app... and many others not available to me before. What I notice is the picture quality is much better than when I did streaming via my Bluray player. This will do for a few more years until I get a new TV that can download all the streaming apps."
2444,Darshan Ponna,2020-01-19,Fire TV Stick,True,5.0,Real Deal,"All you need to have is HDMI port in your TV. Any TV with HDMI port will support Fire stifk. My TV was Samsung Plasma 43 inches with 2 HDMI ports and Fire stick is working in both the ports. I have Android MI TV in my home too but plasma TV with fire stick is even good if your TV is HD ready with HDMI port then you don't need a smart Android tv. There isn't much difference fire stick is real deal go for it. I'm slightly disappointed with myself as I bought this on Jan 5th for 3999 and Jan 19th the price is reduced to 3199 in Great Indian sale if you want to make your Dumb TV into a smart TV then go for Fire stick it's really amazing.
Pros:
1.Alexa built in remote
2. Supports almost all apps
3.Can download games from store.
4. Plug in and use anytime anywhere
5. Alexa is working amazingly compared to Google assistant in my MI Tv
6.Made my dumb plasma TV from 2013 into a smart TV.
Cons:
1.Casting takes little bit time to establish connection.
2. Need to have a high speed WiFi connection for firestick doesn't work with mobile hotspot unlike smart TV.
Now it is available at Rs.3199/- it's a real deal go for it without any doubt. Highly recommend."

2595,Amazon Customer,2020-01-12,Fire TV Stick,True,5.0,Awesome üëç,"Here's the detailed review of this product
IAM using this past 1 year and I think IAM eligible for this
Firstly it converts Ordinary TV into smart one only condition is that tv must be HDMI enabled
You can watch premium content from either Netflix,voot,prime video and many others
Note that if u don't have prime subscription that doesn't matters(it's not mandatory) u should have any online platform subscription to play content
Other important point is it requires wifi connection. IAM using 10 Mbps network speed and works fine with me.
PROS
u can connect Bluetooth devices like joystick (For Asphalt it's perfect!) Yes it's true that u can play games like Asphalt 8 Airborne and hungry shark world etc
It works perfectly fine with TV remote but not as fast as given Bluetooth remote
Very convenient to setup and so easy and can cast the screen
Cons
Only problem I faced is draining of battery of blue tooth remote is so fast
(ALITER: U can buy rechargable Batteries or Download FIRE TV STICK APP from play store and control ur TV with smart phone"

Sometimes so slow that I feel like breaking it into two and throwing it in the TRASH CAN, while making a video of this only to send it to Jezz Bezos. Well, you may argue that it's cheap. It ain't cheap though - at almost 4,000 INR. I'm sure in another year's time, this will be sooooo slow that buyers will look for the newer firestick version, which I'm sure will be slow enough to make them keep buying every 2 years.

By just paying 3200, I converted my normal tv into smart tv. Device quality is excellent. Has all the popular apps..
Streaming quality is very good too. Moreover you can easily watch cable tv channels for Free without cable tv connection. Just see any YouTube video on how to install third party apps which plays cable tv channels. They are easy to install..
Only thing require is fast internet wifi connection, probably around 50mbps speed for it to work smoothly..
Kids are loving it as it also comes preloaded with many games. * Subscription charges in some games and apps.*
Thank You amazon for making this wonderful piece of equipment.!
Worth every penny.
Don't forget to buy either extended warranty or total protection plan.

Video playback in android tv browsers is okay but the speed is slow when its in browser compared to an android tv app. If u r okay to afford go for Mi Android Tv box around Rs. 5000 but FireTvStick is good for around rs. 3000. More than 3000 rs is not worth in my point of view."

2952,Raja Bhat,2019-12-23,Fire TV Stick,True,5.0,Superb Device,"I live in the USA, spending 3 months in India so got this device; I have Airtel broadband where I live. I am very pleased with it; I do have Amazon Prime, and the movie choices are excellent. Screen mirroring works great with my Galaxy Tab. During setup it did not display the Airtel's 5 G connection, but later in Settings I could connect to the 5 G. The product works flawlessly. Earlier Kindle devices would not run YouTube but this one does and really, is one main reason I chose it over Roku. In the USA I have a Google Chromecast and also 2 Roku units including a Roku Ultra. This device is as good as those, really. Someone complained that it does not work with a Jio app, but Amazon does say what all apps will run on it. Your choice."

A one movie for 4 members could save a lot and recover half the cost of the device. I play movies through broadband connection and the video/sound quality is too good. I can see movies which I have missed, if available. I can also re-watch DTH programs too, music and lots more, depending upon free available resources and paid subscriptions. A person can download lot of apps. Hotstar, Amazon Prime, Netflix will require subscription.  So have a budget for at least one paid channel to derive full benefit. One will find select movies in each source. So do some R&D before buying and get budget The other option is to forego some channels on DTH and utilize the money in buying paid subscriptions."

Sometimes Hotstar lags a lot during a match, but that is the only thing with it I've seen so far. Everything else works flawlessly.
Netflix, Hotstar, Prime video. That is the trinity of media consumption right now. A great buy. Better than cable TV that's for sure.
Another negative is that it needs to be plugged in all the time. But despite that, 5 stars because it does what the product should do.
But if you have these online subscriptions that are supported, then you have no reason to not buy this great product."

I wish that amazon launches FireTV Recast here in INDIA which works with these sticks on DVB-S/S2 or with our existing cable on DVB - C/C2  or another box to stream DVB-T/T2X to re-transmit terrestrial signal over wi-fi network.
I would like to have best quality amazon soundbar with echo and firetv + DVB-T2 built-in  so that I can just connect HDMI cable to my 24"" or 32"" LED TV and start watching. Single device and no mess of cables.
Different soundbar for different size TV's, because in near future I am going for 55"" 4K LED TV and 4K LASER projector as well."

I am not too tech savvy and thought I wouldnt be able to handle the firestick, but once it is plugged in and set up, the number of apps, movies and Tv shows are overwhelming.
It takes time to get used to Alexa, the voice remote,  But In the end Alexa is a very helpful companion.
I wont get into the features etc since many people have discussed this before me.
Happy with this gift overall."

3296,Karrie,2019-12-03,Fire TV Stick,True,4.0,A great tech upgrade for not so Smart TVs,"I order Fire stick for my parents' house as they have an old Sony Bravia TV (not a smart, nay a dumb TV ;). Initially in setup it took a while as there was an issue. Fortunately, I found a troubleshooting article on their help forum which solved the issue.
After that all good and streaming is good for the most part. Though every now and then it wouldn't catch signal for a while. Always resolved by itself after it found stable WiFi. I doubt it was more related to WiFi quality. Later we got Jio Fiber and this occurrences became minimal.
All in a very good product to enhance the TVs which doesn't have apps in itself. Some old TV has really good picture quality and it might just be worth it to upgrade tech rather than the TV altogether. It's cheaper on your wallet as well as slightly eco-friendly."
3297,Kamaljeet Singh,2019-12-03,Fire TV Stick,False,5.0,One day use review,"Recently brought it from a Croma store and writing this small review after just a day of use. Fire stick is really good in terms of build quality.
Works smooth, also has Bluetooth (which I wasn't aware of earlier) so you can connect your other devices such as Bluetooth Home theater/Keyboard & mouse, Wireless gamepad, etc.
A little disappointed as Voice search and integration in other apps is not available except Amazon prime video and music but you can just install the Fire TV app from Google play store and use your phone as a remote to use the Fire stick and type in directly from the phone's keyboard.
Video quality is really good. WiFi connectivity is also great. I have installed Asphalt 8 to test the performance and I was amazed that the game just works flawless. Internal storage is just 8GB which can be better. Overall it's a good device in case you're planning to upgrade your regular TV to a fully functional smart TV."

I tried using Alexa but it did not return the exact match.
Screen mirroring is good when you play videos on prime, YouTube and other apps which is already available on firestick, but you can't play downloaded videos of any external app other than mobile phone library. Phone video mirroring is good but not smooth.

Major cons: The screen mirroring from mobile does not show video. It only mirrors audio. The screen mirroring works perfectly fine with TV but not with this firestick.

3351,Subhro,2019-11-30,Fire TV Stick,True,1.0,After sales Product durability and Support issues.,I am a gadget lover so almost devices from Amazon are in my collection. In first year the products from Amazon working good but the issues arises after the year when warranty goes over. In my case Firetv stop mirroring suddenly after update. Customer care said the issue is common and Amazon software team working on it. Past few months I am unable to cust my video on TV. Smart Light provided with ECHO Dot 3 stopped changing colour after few months of use and so on. Price of Amazon devices are equal to the price they sell at Europe yet after sell service is too poor compared to them.

3383,Satish jain,2019-11-28,Fire TV Stick,True,5.0,Totally changed the viewing experience,Stream quality of Amazon prime youttube Netflix is great only fault with Amazon prime is that we can not select video quality like 720 p or 360 p like in YouTube and other apps Amazon can do it in next update . And some third party apps buffer may be because of their weak servers . And screen miroring works flawless although u cant play online games like pubg through screen  miroring because of point second lag. Other wise it has totally changed viewing experience at our home we have stopped recharging Tata sky . The hd experience of fire stick and sound quality is far better than hd of d2h connections it is a must buy thing if u r into watching online content.

It plays most of the widely used Apps, except  Jio TV, Airtel Xtreme. I wish these apps are made available on this device by Amazon.  Update for apps are received whenever there is any update.  Device Operations/moving from 1 app to other is very slow due to low RAM, Streaming quality and speed is good, it depends on internet connection speed.  Overall satisfactory performance considering the price if your are an average user."

T.v streaming app keeps on loading/ buffering up, apps like zee5 works so slow on this that it keeps on ""exiting"" to the main menu or it keeps on ""buffering"" ""start"" and ""buffer"" after every few seconds but if you use the same app at the same time and the same series/movies on the laptop then it works smoothly- which in turn ""rules out"" any network problem
I have Airtel broadband 40mb speed connecting and my network works fine on my laptop, therefore  it is not a network/connectivity issue
its better to buy T.V which has higher specifications then this"

There are few problems though which are common with all the android smart TVs and android boxes like
1. Limited storage to install apps and games.
2. Limited RAM, so the interface gets slow with time.
3. WiFi connectivity needs to be improved as it does not detect WiFi signals similar to an android smartphone.
4. No proxy input support in the interface for individual saved WiFi networks.
5. Accessories are costly like ethernet adapter, remote, etc.
Rest assured I've found it as a great device. Also If you wait for sales then you can grab it for cheaper price."

Even if the product works fine, the Amazon Team will con you if you get any product issues and yo uare nearing the warranty expiry.
I had issued with the device and instead of changing the device they insisted on changing the remote and by the replacement remote came, my warranty period almost over.
I called them up and they promised to again repalce the remote instead of the device and that it wil solve the problem. But they played me - They did not place a replacement request nor did they records my call. The next time i call to check, they say that there was never a call made regarding this and nothing showed up in their records.
 Now the replacement remote is equally useless (as the issue was with the device) and there is not warranty support.
They just coned me..  Go for all the alternatives available in the market."

Firestick works well.
I had a problem with the HDMI adapter which Amazon didnt have replacement but did help me purchase a 3 feet HDMI male-female and refunded the wire cost as my device was new and within warranty.
Streaming is excellent no problem.
The major drawback is voice recognition which Amazon has to work a lot.
It hardly undertands anything.
Searching for non English words fails 100%.
Google Chromecast is much better in this, I don't own, however used one that my friend has.
Please teach ur device voice recognition....."

Fire Stick provides a single view of the VOD content/ channels you have and with the voice search it is super easy. While in every other method you will have to switch between apps (Netflix to prime video to Zee5 etc.) in fire stick you have one view of the promoted content. You can also voice search a content and Fire Stick does a voice based search for you.

Make sure you restart the fire tv stick at least once in 2 -3 days, depending on how much you use, especially if you are switching between apps. It tends to get slow over a period of time."

3930,Prateek,2019-11-13,Fire TV Stick,True,3.0,Dire need to update the hardware and software of the current version,"Hardware Upgrade -
Primarily for speed - Fire TV Stick is slow in response and connecting to the apps. Even with the best network connectivity there is a huge lag user will be able to notice. Definitely an upgrade in the hardware (processor + memory) is required
Software Upgrade -
Bluetooth connectivity - supports a very old version of drivers which sucks if you are connecting a 5.1 speaker/subwoofer system.
Should support more audio drivers including generic manufacturers.
Loads of feature are available outside India in terms of software/app support by other vendors. Definitely need to work on it.
Conclusion -
With all the above mentioned cons, Fire TV Stick is an affordable option in Indian market although mediocre in it's features. Amazon should think on releasing another option which has a better performance (and not just another 4k support)."

4147,Amazon Customer,2019-11-10,Fire TV Stick,True,1.0,Worst experience with firestick,"We have had the worst experience with the fire stick. Within a week of buying the firestick, the remote would discharge. we would add new battery and within 3-4 days it would discharge as well. We got it replaced from amazon but the second remote also started with the same problem within in a few days.
We have used the fire stick for only a few months, now it has started with a new problem, the connection gets lost again and again and the device keeps doing some software update every now and then. We have called amazon and they say that the third party will do the service and repairs but the number provided by amazon customer support does not respond/ connect. We have sent emails with no response! Its much better to go with google chrome, or other competitive sticks...this is such a waste of money!
 Watching TV has become such a pain, with frequent disconnects!
Am surprised why Amazon is marketing such faulty devices and why they would not cover for service and take accountability for the same."

Jio Cinema, hotstar, zee all working great. Lots of non premium content which can be viewed without premium subscriptions. Prime video has wonderful contents but it's not mandatory to enjoy the device.
Installation was quick pain free and tv was integrated automatically, can be switched on/ off with voice command. Casting is fun.
Adjust quality of video depending on data availability and internet bandwidth to enjoy lag free streaming.
Apple TV works superb on fire stick.
Remarkable. Recommend with 6 star."

Apps work very smooth as compared to  any andriod box in the market. App like Netflix, YouTube, Hotstar and Voot are very smooth to watch and with great streaming quality at 1080p. But gerenally quality will depend on internet speed. People who planning to use Jio sim for internet won't be disappointed. If you not having Netflix subscription, amazon prime content library is huge for prize it is been offered. Overall additional features like Dolby digital sound, multi audio tracks, voice recognition and alexa integration given me more compaling reason to buy the fire TV stick."

4229,Hrishikesh Sowani,2019-11-09,Fire TV Stick,True,5.0,Best way to watch television in the connected world.,"Scrapped 3 Tata Sky set top boxes I had and am happy with these fire sticks now. Used tata sky since 2006-2019. End of era. Lot of flexibility as well as cost advantage. You can use JIO internet or home wifi router to watch daily programs + Annual subscriptions for Zee5, HotStar, Amazon Prime and Voot etc offer range of channels. Also saves headache of calling support/service centers every now and then. Also no overhead of ""multy tv"" or  overwhelming ""HD viewing fees"" which I used to pay for years together. It was a loot if we look back."

Secondly, it i not HD streaming. General quality streaming which is largely due to the apps available.
Thirdly, pairing with Alexa device is a complete waste e.g. Alexa Echo Dot. It has Alexa on the on the remote which is slow on the uptake.
Innovative idea. Poor execution. Apple TV device far far superior."

I asked for the entire set to be replaced as your tech support doesn‚Äôt know what exactly is the fault. However, I am asked to buy a new fire stick tv and told that I will get the refund of the new amount once it arrives. This is so unthoughtful of Amazon, the largest company in the world, that claims to have Earth‚Äôs most customer centric approach as their motto. I simply asked the rep to replace the set and I should not be getting into the process of placing a new order and then getting a refund. So since you guys cudnt help, so I also went ahead and cancelled my prime membership as well. Hats off to your customer centric approach !!"

Most streaming apps are available on the Amazon platform. The streaming quality is pretty decent. The Alexa integrated remote is pretty good as well, though it tends to struggle a bit when locating content that are from a non-English language. The best thing I like about the product is the VoiceView screen reader that is integrated with the Firestick. As a visually impaired user, it makes it possible for me to use the device independently. Hope Amazon would through software, provide better TTS options and improve Alexa non-English voice recognition in the future."

We have smart TVs based on Android and also certified Android tv. But experience with Amazon fire TV stick is way better than them . Its very smooth. There is no lag . You can install any Android app by sideload the app from your mobile . You can download fire tv app from playstore and  use your mobile as remote . I have used Android tv box as well but experience with fire tv stick is very smooth than that. I think its better to buy a non smart tv rather than smart and purchase this Amazon fire tv stick with saved money .
Really happy with this"

It took me a while to figure this out because the guys and girls at the Amazon helpline didn‚Äôt advice me to change my single band router although they were helpful with everything else. They even changed my firestick. My brother told me that they have rules that won‚Äôt allow them to tell me to change my router. You need at least 25mbps of speed for this device to work fine but if multiple devices are connected, you need more speed. Make sure you disconnect your device during heavy rains.
